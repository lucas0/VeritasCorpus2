  If you’ve ever been on a bad date and needed an “emergency” excuse to walk out the door, then you’ll be even more relieved by a new, helpful trend sweeping bars across the globe. Not only are waitstaff helping women flee a bad date, they want to help keep you out of harm’s way.

 <p>
  At Iberian Restaurant in St. Petersburg, FL, this means there is a discreet sign in the women’s restroom that reads “Is your Tinder date not who they said they were on their profile? Do you feel unsafe or even just a tad bit weird?” If so, the sign advises, order an “angel shot.”

  Wait, what is this mysterious drink? Well it’s actually not booze at all. It’s a code that will discreetly tell the bartender you need help, the Tampa Bay Times reports.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s how it works: Order an angel shot neat and a bartender will escort you to your car. Ask for it with ice and the bartender will call a taxi or Uber for you. Order it with lime and the restaurant staff will call the police.

  Apparently this code word was inspired by a similar movement in London, where women are “asking for Angela” to signal an unsafe situation during a date. It was created by The Lincolnshire Rape Crisis, a support service for women and girls in East England.
